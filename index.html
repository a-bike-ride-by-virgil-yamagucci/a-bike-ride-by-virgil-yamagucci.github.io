            <p class="indent up">But then she sent me a video of her clapping her feet and laughing, and blushing, fulling clothed in a old sweater with her hair in a messy ponytail with no make up with her roommate standing bewildered in the background. And that's when I knew.</p>

            <p class="indent">There was no other option, really. No other option. Fate was standing directly in front of me, at this point, completely naked. Literally, she sent me a picture of her breasts. I'd have to be absolutely so completely stupidly blind not to see it, not to see the signs. The sexy signs. Brown haired, brown eyed, pale skinned, long legged, angle voiced, mole on her right cheek, misshapen left nippled, weird eared, ugly footed, Fate. Naked. Bearing her full and beautiful breasts. With a whip. Threatening harm onto my house and city and life and soul. Threatening all these things with her whip. And she would whip me, and brand her name on my thigh with a hot prong if I didn't do exactly as she asked. And I did not want to be whipped and or branded kind of.</p>

            <div class="text-messages">
                <p class="her smaller">seriously are my feet flat though really???</p>
            </div>

            <p class="indent">As any young beautiful man does, I went into the bathroom and flexed a little in the mirror. I slapped my face and chest a few times until slightly rare and, given the context of the situation, I gave myself a little pep talk. I washed my face and bent over to smell my balls, and then washed my balls and penis.</p>

            <div class="text-messages">
                <p class="him small-him">i need to stop by the gas station on fifth to get some condoms</p>

            <p class="indent">God, it was a hot day. I'm not talking about the weather. But yeah it was a fucking hot day too.</p>
            <p class="indent up">As soon as I opened my door, the illusion of paradise that is an air conditioned apartment shattered and I began to sweat immediately. My neighbor's dog was lounging out in the sun on the grass, tanning and thoroughly enjoying life. He's a big bastard of a thing. A big beautiful boy. If you know anything about Bernese Mountain dogs you'd know they have these tiny brown spots above their eyes that look like eyebrows. Man, was he a cute, big, motherfucker.</p>
            <p class="indent up">As I was locking my door, all I could see was a blur of fur in my periphery. When you're thinking about sex and beautiful women and sex with beautiful women you don't notice certain things. When your nervous system is accelerating into the future, careening through the cosmos in an astral state, leaving your mortal body behind on the limited and physical plane, you tend to forget about your surroundings. Your mind is an arrow, a compass, pointing innately towards what you want most in life.</p>
            <p class="indent up">God damn, she's so fucking hot.</p>
            <p class="indent up">Filling my head were visions of her in red lingerie, yet the soft and sweet and ripened sulci of my delicate and oversized brain were processing a deep and langinous pain. Searing pain, a very sensual pain. As if a black belt, a silk and revealing belt with lace detail, in jujistu had grappled and tossed me to the ground and had me locked in her web of very sexy agony. But, no, a wet tongue on my face and the faintness of an allergic reaction betrayed my not-at-all-sexual fantasy.</p>
