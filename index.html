            <p class="indent up">But then she sent me a video of her clapping her feet and laughing, and blushing, fulling clothed in a old sweater with her hair in a messy ponytail with no make up with her roommate standing bewildered in the background. And that's when I knew.</p>

            <p class="indent">There was no other option, really. No other option. Fate was standing directly in front of me, at this point, completely naked. Literally, she sent me a picture of her breasts. I'd have to be absolutely so completely stupidly blind not to see it, not to see the signs. The sexy signs. Brown haired, brown eyed, pale skinned, long legged, angle voiced, mole on her right cheek, misshapen left nippled, weird eared, ugly footed, Fate. Naked. Bearing her full and beautiful breasts. With a whip. Threatening harm onto my house and city and life and soul. Threatening all these things with her whip. And she would whip me, and brand her name on my thigh with a hot prong if I didn't do exactly as she asked. And I did not want to be whipped and or branded kind of.</p>

            <div class="text-messages">
                <p class="her smaller">seriously are my feet flat though really???</p>
            </div>

            <p class="indent">As any young beautiful man does, I went into the bathroom and flexed a little in the mirror. I slapped my face and chest a few times until slightly rare and, given the context of the situation, I gave myself a little pep talk. I washed my face and bent over to smell my balls, and then washed my balls and penis.</p>

            <p class="indent">God, it was a hot day. I'm not talking about the weather. But yeah it was a fucking hot day too.</p>
            <p class="indent up">As soon as I opened my door, the illusion of paradise that is an air conditioned apartment shattered and I began to sweat immediately. My neighbor's dog was lounging out in the sun on the grass, tanning and thoroughly enjoying life. He's a big bastard of a thing. A big beautiful boy. If you know anything about Bernese Mountain dogs you'd know they have these tiny brown spots above their eyes that look like eyebrows. Man, was he a cute, big, motherfucker.</p>
            <p class="indent up">As I was locking my door, all I could see was a blur of fur in my periphery. When you're thinking about sex and beautiful women and sex with beautiful women you don't notice certain things. When your nervous system is accelerating into the future, careening through the cosmos in an astral state, leaving your mortal body behind on the limited and physical plane, you tend to forget about your surroundings. Your mind is an arrow, a compass, pointing innately towards what you want most in life.</p>
            <p class="indent up">God damn, she's so fucking hot.</p>
            <p class="indent up">Filling my head were visions of her in red lingerie, yet the soft and sweet and ripened sulci of my delicate and oversized brain were processing a deep and langinous pain. Searing pain, a very sensual pain. As if a black belt, a silk and revealing belt with lace detail, in jujistu had grappled and tossed me to the ground and had me locked in her web of very sexy agony. But, no, a wet tongue on my face and the faintness of an allergic reaction betrayed my not-at-all-sexual fantasy.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Cash Money, no. Good boy, but no. Not today. Can't play- not today. I've got to have very angry sex with a very angry woman." I struggled under the weight of the mountain beast. "C'mon, Cashey-boy. Beautiful boy." He must have thought I was playing as I attempted to push him off of me. "Money, off- off. If only you understood.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"She's got these long legs like a greyhound." He stopped licking my face and his big black eyes locked onto mine. "Yeah, you understand! And- and- the mind of a pure bred poodle, and the ADHD too. And the talons of a hawk and I'm her prey. And when she's upset she stomps on the ground like a hippopotamus. And she's got the memory of an elephant, a very beautiful Yale alumni elephant. And at night she hunts me with her cat eyes. I'm her little boy mouse with my little rodent teeth and she's like my cheese. She's like the perfect wedge of parmigiano reggiano. She stalks me in the bushes with her sexy cat-eye-night-time-vision. She has a very sexy, very sexy cat body. Sleek lines, perfect musculature. Very sexy feline cat body. If only you could see it.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"If only she would bite me."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"You're into cats now? Like sexually? That's weird. Even for you."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Sandy." The mountain dog looked happily at its owner. All I could see in the summer sun was her wonderful silhouette that looked nothing like a cat but was wonderful still.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Virgil." She said my name very excitedly and not at all like a greeting at the DMV. "You're already over that girl you've been talking about forever now and you're seducing cats and hawks and hippopotamusus?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Hippopotami. No, no-" I pet Cash Money as gravity pressed the entirety of his weight onto my mortal body. "I'm talking about her. Daisy Cat. I mean, Daisy is the cat. Could you please help get Cash off?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"She's a cat?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"It's a metaphor." Sandy stared at me. Cash stared at me. "It was a private conversation. You wouldn't understand."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"But Cash does? Cash, remember, the Bernese mountain dog understands?" I nodded. Cash licked my face. We laughed and Sandy began walking back to her apartment. She called out for Cash Money and he regrettably stood and trotted home. Sandy stood by her door. "Sorry about your pants, by the way." I looked down to find my jeans covered in mud. Mud and maybe even dog shit. "Have fun with Catwoman, Bruce Wayne." These weren't just any pair of pants, Sandy. They weren't even pants. These were my leftwards loomed Japanese denim jeans. My sexy-time jeans. It was very anti-cash-money of Cash Money to get dirty onto my rare and vintage selvedge denim imported all the way from Japan. I haven't washed these jeans in years. They were my special sex jeans.</p>
            <p class="indent up">The shipping alone was two hundred dollars.</p>
            <p class="indent up">I stood in the small pathway, vigorously jumping up and down to loose any gravel then walked to my car and unlocked the rear hatch. I pulled out my fantastic looking bike and slammed down the large door. I slipped on my sports sunglasses, polarized and perfect golden yellow, and rode off beyond the gate of the small complex. I looked back and Cash was standing where I had left him, watching me leave, wagging his perfect tail.</p>
            <p class="indent up">Godspeed, Cash Money, Godspeed.</p><br>
            <p class="indent up">The bike was smooth. The ceramic ball-bearing-crank rotated peacefully under the duress of power of my titan legs. The wind was at my back. It was Fate at work yet again. The last time there was a tailwind so tantalizing was when Agamemnon's army sailed against the beaches and battlements of Troy.</p>
            <p class="indent up">Achilles had his spear and his Phthian warriors, Virgil has his bike and Japanese jeans.</p>
            <p class="indent up">Biking down the road I was the dictionarian picture of largesse.</p>
            <p class="indent up">Today the Gods of Old smiled upon me. I was a hero and undoubtedly looked the part.</p>
            <p class="indent up">To further prove my point, a young girl was sitting on a curb and she must have seen me and my largesse and in her succor, by the means of some ethereal draft and visions divined from Apollo, she called unto me.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Mr. Homeless Man, my cat is in that tree." Ah, the fabled nemean lion, stranded. Me, a hulk of Herculean make. What irony the Fates design. My stars, even in the scorching light of Helios, shone bright. I was bemused.</p>
            <p class="indent up">I was moved by her sorrow and answered heroically to her hapless cries.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I'm not homeless, little girl."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"You smell homeless."</p>
            <p class="indent up">My neighbor's dog jumped on me. A fearsome beast, a gaurdian to a lesser goddess. Paws larger than your head. He could very easily swallow you whole."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Okay."</p>
            <p class="indent up">Her general and peaceful tone commanded me to continue my defensive onslaught.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"This is Japanese denim, small child. It's very rare, very sturdy. A true warrior's garb; I'm not homeless."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Your bike looks old."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"This is a classic Italian steel frame with a modern, Italian drivetrain, Tiny Armed Human. See these shifters? Wireless. Very cool, very new. See these carbon wheels? Very chic. This exact model won the Giro d'Italia before you were even born. This is Daedalus hewn, child.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Yeah, but Henry is in that tree." She pointed at the one I was leaning on. My tree, my Herculean club. It would be an easy effort. I scaled the side of the dilapidated and very old tree and climbed into the main branches.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Where is it?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"There."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"There where."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Up!"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I don't see anything. Call you call out to it?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Henry!"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Henry!"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Henry, a homeless man is here to help! He looks scary but he won't hurt you!"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"What color is his fur?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Pink with blue spots."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I don't see any pink cats, repugnant youth! All I see is a stuffed animal deep in this great tree's branches, tangled in a thicket of auburn-"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"That's Henry! Help! Get Henry! She's scared!"</p>
            <p class="indent up">I pushed my face past a throng of leaves and climbed higher into the tree. I plucked from the branches a toy, a reflection of Heracles reaching for the Golden apples of the Hesperides.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Be careful! She's fragile!"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I'm trying."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"You have to climb higher!"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I don't want my hair to get messed up."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Mr. Short Homeless Man, hurry! Help Henry! She's scared and alone!"</p>
            <p class="indent up">It was a small giraffe. As I pulled Henry loose from the fabric of the old tree the small child yelped with some form of irreverent glee. I tossed it to her and she screamed viscerally with plenty of energy. The apparent mother of the youth ran out of the house, weilding a large cast iron pan, as I cascaded gracefully onto the grass below, levitating downwards as an angel does on any given day descending from the heavens. I definitely didn't fall and scrape my knee. As I was rubbing my knee, I felt a hard and quite hot smack against my arm. She screamed, "Get away from my daughter, vile creature! Overworn, misshapen thug! Scagmouth, penny whore!" I too, in the surge and heat of masculine poison, screamed. Morely, a warrior's roar. The young girl delighted at the violence and judgement cast upon me from the Gods.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Mommy, this homeless man rescued Henry."</p>
            <p class="indent up">Though, thankful as I was for salvation, this was no time to spend dawdling with common folk. This young and very handsome and very tall and very sexually virile Menelaus had every intention of reunited with his Helen.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I'm coming, Helen!"</p>
            <p class="indent up">My clear and bright travels were the evocation and will of Nature.</p>
            <p class="indent up">The gas station was in my sights as I rounded the corner of the street. The monument marked a halfway point to Daisy's apartment. Though, unlike Odysseus, it would not take me ten years to reach my destination.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Do you have any small packs of trojans?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Only magnums."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Right, right. Right. Yeah, yeah. I'll take about, maybe, perhaps, four or two or, yeah, a few. Ten. Who knows. Fifteen."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"We have boxes in the back. Regular sized but much larger packs."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Cool, cool. Yeah, in the back. I'll take a look. Just in case, you know." The cashier was very thoroughly convinced.</p>
            <p class="indent up">Where the trojans would be was largely empty save for a carton pack of one hundred. In my desperation, I hunched down and grabbed the box of one hundred individually warpped candy-flavored colorful-condoms and heard a gunshot.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Give me all the cash in your register, bitch!" Another gunshot. "In the bag, hurry! And some menthols!"</p>
            <p class="indent up">The Gods were testing me. First trial, Heracles' nemean lion. And now a thief and a robber; Paris of a different sort. Another trial as I pressed forward to victory. To have my face etched into the cosmos, this was but a simple effort, a menial task at best. Utilizing my unique gift of stealth, granted to me by Noctis herself, he wouldn't notice my heavenly presence until I take a can of motor oil, and upon application of enough force to concuss, to his creamy fontanels ensuring the demolition of will, extracting the envy of Ajax. Reluctantly, I'd drown him in the viscous fluid. Purging him of his evils with the sweet taste of the black tar. As the medicine to nefarious endeavors bubbles in his lungs, while he confesses his sins to me at the rising meniscus of his fatal breath, I'd honor him in the ritual and birthright of any soul brave enough to attempt tribulation against my heroics: a quick death. Perhaps, then, the Gods would forgive his exponential crimes and I would thusly be elevated to my rightful Godhood.</p> 
            <p class="indent up">"You in the back!" I looked around. "Yeah, you! Holding the smaller-sized candy condoms! Come here and don't do anything fucking dumb!" I approached masked Paris. "Your wallet. Your phone. Those glasses too. What the fuck are you hesitating for?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">He held the gun steady, pointed at my beautiful face. I looked at the barrel of gun, my eyes crossed at the smoke emanating from the tip. Behind him, the cashier was filling the bag. </p>
            <p class="indent up">"And take off your pants. I like those pants."</p>
            <p class="indent up">This is when I would say something very clever. A bafflement of wit, an exercise of an engorged intelligence.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"These aren't pants, they're Japanese denim."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Why are you buying so many tiny trojans anyways?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I was heading to a girl's place."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Your girlfriend?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"No."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"She's out of your league, huh? I see. She'd fuck you, but wouldn't make you a husband, huh?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"She's- I'm- Look, scoundrel."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I heard her ex-boyfriend, Brad, has a huge penis." Perhaps he didn't say this, and I remember this only in the fever of dreams. "How the fuck you about to have sex covered in dirt and smelling like shit? Brad would never have had looked so distressed."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"It's a long story."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"This gun is long in your face, bitch."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"My neighbors dog, Cerberus, a Great Dane with velvet black fur, leapt onto me before I left my apartment. Then a young girl asked me to get her cat out of a tree and-"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"And then you shit your pants when I pointed my gun at you, huh?" The villain snorted, his identity revealed: one of Circe's many thugs.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Look, can I at least text her real quick saying I'm on the way but currently being held at gunpoint?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Hell no. You'll just call the police, 'lil bitch."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I've known her for a few years now and this moment is everything to me. We talk everyday and we never get bored- She's literally the most beautiful- This might be my one chance to-"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Okay, okay. Shut the fuck up and show me a picture of her then. God damn, yeah. She hot as Hell. She got some nice flat feet too. Long toes. Damn. I might just steal her from you too." He laughed. "Keep your phone unlocked and put it in my pocket or I'll blow your dick off and you'll never get to fuck her. I'm going to look at her pictures and maybe give her a call tonight. Hurry up and take off your pants, loverboy, I wanna see what you're working with compared to Brad's giant dick." I handed my jeans over to the assailant. He took them in his limbering arms and there was a splash of heat against my face and body. Through the black balaclava, his eyes went grey and rolled into the back of his head. There was a second spraying of blood as the cashier unloaded a second round of shotgun slugs into Pig Paris' side.</p>
            <p class="indent">"What were you doing when the burglar came into the store?" The officer asked me. There was a torrent of them. Five squad cars pulled into the station halting all surrounding traffic, shutting down the station for investigation and secondary safety precautions.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I was about to purchase some magnum sized condoms at the register." She looked at me plainly in a very convinced manner.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Well, the good news is that we were able to find the gunman's accomplice speeding away from the scene. But, unfortunately, we'll have to take in your jeans as evidence since they're covered in blood and what seems to be fecal matter. Do you have an extra pair available to you?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"There are no extras. They're imported directly from Nihon."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"You sure you don't want to stick around for a bit? Relax? Let the paramedics take a look at you? What happened in there is pretty traumatic. I'm sure your girlfriend will understand if you're a little late."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"She's not my girlfriend and I'm not in love." I laughed handsomely at the insuation.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I didn't say you were?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">I washed what mess of blood I could from my face, neck, and arms in one of the gas station's soapy basins. The owner gave me the box of condoms and a spare shirt, a crop top, for free due to the inconvenience. After texting Daisy that there was a small detour, keen to leave out any gruesome and un-sexy detail, I hopped onto my bike and my bare and pale legs in the scorching heat reddened within a few seconds of riding down the road.</p>
            <p class="indent up">Finally, there it was, shining in its glory: the Gates of Troy: Daisy's high-rise apartment complex. It was a magnificent and tall thing. The sun reflected directly off of Daisy's window and shone directly into my eye. The pain was bliss. I saw, for a brief moment, what I believed to be the silhouette of a Goddess, with a capital G, in the polished windows of her suite. I knew exactly where her apartment was located. Every time I dropped off Daisy I'd look up at her floor as I drove away. Ensuring her light came on, ensuring her safety. The shadow in the window had the beautiful long slender legs akin to the perfectly shaped bow wielded by Odysseus. Oh, how I wished to be the fingers upon that bow. My pupils dilated at the gilded figure, I rose my arms into the air to wave.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"You're an absolute psychopath." The shrill groans of a siren called to me, "You're an absolute psychopath. My parents were right to tell me to break up with you. Look at you."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Alondra." The Goddess Circe warned me of this. that I was fated to sail upon a monster in the sea at a rocky shore towards my destination. A beast that ate any ship unfortunate enough to pass through her cove. The Gods sent me visions of her tentacles, with sharp spines and teeth, reaching out to end me. Perhaps run me over with her vehicle. Alondra leaned from the driver's seat to scream at me through the open window.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"You think you can just bike down the road wihtout any pants carrying a box of candy condoms in what may very well be one of my old crop tops on your ugly bike? You fucking pervert."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"It's not what it looks like."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Oh. So you're not biking down a busy road downtown half-naked with a huge box of tiny condoms waving at the sky like a freak?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"My bike is not ugly."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Oh, do keep going on about your stupid bike and your love for bikes. Oh, do keep going on about it and avoiding the question." She drove next to me, slowing down everyone behind her. Swallowing their rage and impatience in her violent wake. They honked, she only spoke louder to reach her barbed, loose words beyond the noise.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I was at that gas station and it was being robbed."</p>
            <p class="indent up">She opened her passenger door while we were at a red light.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Get in the car."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"No, I can't. I've somewhere to be. Grave importance, more important than you."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"You cannot possibly be going anywhere looking like that."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I'm meeting someone. I'm going to have sex with a beautiful woman that isn't you."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Who? Daisy?" She laughed, her waves thrashing about my stalwart ego, "She would never have sex with you! She told me herself, you know. Back when she was dating her ex-boyfriend Brad. Remember him? That six foot five freak? He was a real man. He had a huge penis, remember?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Nobody remembers Brad. Brad who?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Everybody remembers Brad."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Of course I remember Brad. Blue-eyed Brad. You were always in love with him even when we were dating."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Everyone is in love with Brad! You're in love with Brad! He's tall, gorgeous, charismatic. Everything you're not. Brad got laser hair removal on his legs, you know." I looked down at my legs. I should have shaved them. The Greeks shaved their legs before battle. "Daisy is still in love with Brad. She told me the other day</p>
            <p class="indent up">"She did?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Mhm. We get coffee every once in awhile and talk about our ex-boyfriend's penises. When I told her about the scar tissue you have on your balls she choked on her coffee with laughter."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"A bee stung me when I was a kid and it never healed properly. I was bed ridden for days, I couldn't walk."</p>
            <p class="indent up">You're just a short freak with weird balls and an ugly bike."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Daisy likes my body. And my penis. I have proof."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Have you seen Brad's penis?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Everybody has seen Brad's penis."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Now Brad has a nice penis." Brad does have a nice penis.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Brad's penis is a six a best. And only in the right lighting. The cosmetic circumcision he had was subpar at best." Alondra laughed. We pulled up next to the entrance of the building. I hopped off my bike and she slowed her car to a stop illegally holding up traffic.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Let's get coffee sometime." I leaned into the open window.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Yeah, I'd like that. Bring Daisy."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Only if you bring Brad."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"But, no, seriously. You two are cute together."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"We're not dating or anything like that."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Mhm. You'll have to tell me the full story."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Of my appearance right now?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Of everything."</p>
            <p class="indent">I washed her drive off and I wheeled my bike into the building. The air conditioning greeted me before the doorman. The hub of the carbon wheels clicked softly amongst the lobby's commotion. The white marble floors and pillars shone bright. All guests floated in their linen gowns and crowns of golden leaves and wild flowers. As I approached the large stone desk, the very kind looking very handsome man greeted me with a look of absolute disgust and bewildered contempt.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Security, we have a Code 9 in the lobby. Standby." He spoke loudly into the mic attached to his lapel. "I'm sorry, sir and or madame, we don't allow homeless people-"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I'm not homeless."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Or solicitors on the premises. I'm going to have to ask you to vacate the property immediately."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"No, no. I'm a guest of one of your residents." He eyed me thoroughly, "I have condoms."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I can see that."</p>
            <p class="indent up">There was a very long and fantastic pause. He didn't move. Or blink.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I was robbed at a gas station. The one on Fifth, just around the corner. You might have heard the sirens. That's why I'm not wearing my sexy-time jeans."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Excuse me?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I punched the robber in the face and he bled all over me. When he tried shooting, I jumped over him and broke his elbow in a standing, backflip, arm-bar suplex. The cashier threw me a shotgun and I blew his head clean off. That's why there's blood on my arms still. I couldn't get everything off."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I thought that was dried poop."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Yeah, that too. I also rescued a young girl's wild savanna cat from the canopy of century old redwood. I climbed to the very top and the cat nearly clawed my eyes out, but I sang to calm it down."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"What song did you sing?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Thong Song by Sisqo."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"And what about the condoms?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I'm here to have sex with a beautiful woman."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"And is she aware about this sex?" His hand rose to his lapel.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Yes. Very aware. It was her idea."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"And she's sober? A sober willful participant?"</p> 
            <p class="indent up">"Yes. Very sober, she only drinks water. She's very superbly willing." He was very convinced. "Daisy Cat. I mean, Daisy. I'm here to see Daisy. You might have seen me before. Sometimes we eat together alone at dimly light and expensive restaurants and I drop her off. I drive a black car, a black little Japanese hybrid hatchback with enough space in the trunk to fit a legendry road bike."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"You're Virgil? The Virgil Daisy doens't stop talking about?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"She talks about me?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Nevermind that."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"You know that feeling, after you have an intimate dinner with someone?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Love?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Horny. Horniness. Horny horniness. Pure unadulterated sexual and emotional desire."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"You said emotional desire."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Very, very sexual and not in any way emotionally driven sexual very sexual desires. When your heart beats really fast when she looks into your eyes and when she laughs at her own jokes or small mistakes you can't help but feel the back of your neck rise in tempurature and when your hands kind of touch but they don't and when you're sitting close together and your knees are resting on each other's and you sweat because you're so horny with horniess. And when you two schedule to hang out with her and her friends but they never show up because apparently they all got stuck in the air skydiving so it's just the two of you and you're at dinner and she looks very beautiful in her favorite dress and you two forget to even eat because you can't stop talking. Very sexy."</p>
            <p class="indent up">He looked at me handsomely and I couldn't discern the intention behind the baffled and nauseated look on his face.</p>
            <p class="indent up">Nevertheless, what I said, along with the Hectorian force than is my own charisma, he permitted my passage beyond the superficial fortress gates. The large metal doors opened with a soft hiss and a cloud of ethereal dust. I could hear my heart as the elevator rose. I checked my appearance in the reflection of my phone and quickly put it away. In the few seconds it took to get to her floor, lifetimes of scenarios streamed through my consciousness.</p>
            <p class="indent up">The hallway to her door was lavish, and long, and filled with the wonderful natural lighting of a setting sun.</p>
            <p class="indent up">Apartment 1009.</p>
            <p class="indent up">The gyrating sound of a blender bled into the hallway through her already open door. I peered my head in and her roomate was in the kitchen eating peeled slices of persimmon.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Zelda."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Virgil, hey- Holy shit. You look like you just fought in a battle to the death."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Thank you."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"It wasn't- Come in and close the door."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Daisy in her room?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"No, she's not here. Yeah, she left about fifteen minutes ago."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I thought she was waiting for me." I wasn't sad at all.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Why do you look so sad? She heard gunshots around where the gas station was that you were supposed to be and she went out looking for you like a crazy person. I told her you'd be fine but she insisted on running out to find you. You know how she gets. Irritable. Impatient. Well, you just going to stand there or you going to explain why you look the way you do?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Have you heard about Hercules' Trials?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Yes. You always bring them up."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I was called to find in a great war. Outside my apartment I was attacked by a pack of wolves. They trampled me, fighting for the muscle on my tight body. Then I took the thorn out from the pad of a lion's paw. It was a restless and poor thing. I saved her and now she remains my campanion for life. Then a young girl called out to me, she called to me in her succor upon seeing my largess, her house was on fire. I rescued her mother from the burning building and she offered me her hand in marriage. And at the gas station, well, let's just say tonight when you gaze upon the many stars you shouldn't be surprised to see my very visage, my likeness, reflected in the great expanse of twinkling orbs."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"You're both insane. You look exhausted. Just relax. I'm making mango smoothies." I sat in the middle of their living room, in the exact spot Daisy had taking the video she sent earlier and found her phone on the floor.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"She left her phone."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"I told you. She literally ran out of here like a crazy person. Didn't even wait for the elevator. She just ran down the stairs yelling she would rescue you."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Do you know when she'll be back?"</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Nope. She could be looking for you the rest of the night. Who knows with her. But, well, hold on." Zelda walked into her room and I shut my eyes for a second. She tapped my shoulder and handed me a towel. "You can take a shower, if you'd like. No, you definitely should take a shower if you're going to wait."</p>
            <p class="indent up">"Thank you, Zelda. You're very kind." I pushed up and my body felt very heavy. She asked me if I was okay as I wobbled away nodding assent.</p>
            <p class="indent up">"When you're doing come get a smoothie."</p>
            <p class="indent up">Zelda's smoothies were notoriously delicious.</p>
            <p class="indent">The warm water was a boon.</p>
            <p class="indent up">It washed over me, stampeding against the worries of the hour past. With the steam in my nose I felt fantastic and polished. I massaged the floral shampoo into my scalp hoping to scrape away the raw images of the man's death and pollinate in its place new verdance. The dried blood on my arms and neck came off easily and I watched silently as the remnants of someone's existence withered into the drain. Daisy's body wash smelled so wonderful. Being emulsified in her scent I felt rescued; I decided then and there that when I'm to be mummified, this fluid would be choice for my embalming. I rested my head against the smooth tile and allowed the waterfall to sedate me. After drying, I found my enleadened body on Daisy's rug. My encumbered limbs and joints, composed of granite and concrete and viscous paste, sprawled themselves on the thick pile. It smelled of use and I wondered if that's what her feet smelled like. With that, the scent of her feet on my face and the ceiling fan circling peacefully, hypnotically above, the floor was a wonderful, and the only place, to be. Zelda came in laughing at the composition and set a smoothie down for me on her desk. I felt a pair of eyes watching me from a bookshelf. There was a soft welcoming meow, a whirr of a blender fading softly and slowly away, and then there was all silence and calm.</p>
            <p class="indent up">When my eyes opened next, the room was dark and cool. The city lights were escaping into the large windows. An arm was wrapped around my torso, a pair of feet rested themselves on my legs, a perfect cheek pressed against my chest, and a wonderful nose buried into my neck. On top of our bodies was a warm blanket, and beneath our heads was a singular and comfortable pillow. Daisy twitched lightly in her sleep, likely reaching out desperately for me in some distant dream realm, and her slender fingers clinched onto my skin. Her nails scratched me very slightly and it was very lovely.</p>
            <p class="indent">There was nothing left to do, no other option, but smile and sleep deeply.</p>
